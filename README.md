Use a dataset from the city of Toronto on COVID19 cases https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/covid-19-cases-in-toronto, wrote a Spark machine learning algorithm in order to predict the fatality rates in the Toronto area
Build up an algorithm model to evaluate and predict number of patients that may possibly enter into a hospital and fatalities of them.
Tool â€¢ Use Spark on Google Cloud Platform to build up evaluation and prediction algorithm model model with accuracy 98%
Use PowerBI to finish visualization.
